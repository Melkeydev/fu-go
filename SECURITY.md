# Security Features Documentation

## Enhanced Security Implementation

This version of fu-go implements multiple security layers to protect against accidental or malicious removal of Go installations.

### üîí Triple Confirmation System

The system implements three mandatory confirmation steps:

1. **Initial Confirmation**: User must type `CONFIRM`
2. **Security Hash**: User must type a dynamically generated 8-character hash
3. **Final Confirmation**: User must type `DESTROY` to proceed

### üîç Intelligent Installation Detection

The system automatically detects Go installations from multiple sources:

- **Official Installations**: `/usr/local/go`, `/opt/go`, `C:\Go`
- **GVM (Go Version Manager)**: `~/.gvm/gos/*`
- **Homebrew** (macOS): `/usr/local/Cellar/go/*`, `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/*`
- **Package Managers** (Linux): `/usr/lib/golang`, `/usr/share/golang`
- **Snap Packages**: Detects installations via snap

For each detected installation, the system provides:
- Full path
- Go version
- Installation source
- Size occupied
- Directory permissions

### üìã Detailed Logging System

All logs are saved to `~/.fugo/fugo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`:

```
[2025-06-25 10:30:15] INFO: Found 2 Go installations
[2025-06-25 10:30:15] INFO: Installation: /usr/local/go (go version go1.21.0 linux/amd64, official)
[2025-06-25 10:30:16] INFO: First confirmation step passed
[2025-06-25 10:30:18] INFO: Second confirmation step passed
[2025-06-25 10:30:20] INFO: All confirmation steps passed, proceeding with operation
[2025-06-25 10:30:21] SUCCESS: Backup created at: /home/user/.fugo/backups
[2025-06-25 10:30:25] SUCCESS: Go uninstallation completed successfully
```

### üíæ Automatic Backup System

Before any removal, the system:

1. Creates compressed backup (.tar.gz) of all installations
2. Saves to `~/.fugo/backups/go_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
3. Verifies backup integrity before proceeding
4. Logs backup location in the logs

### üîê Permission Validation

The system verifies:

- **Write Permissions**: Tests if it can write to target directories
- **Administrative Privileges**: Detects if sudo/admin is required
- **Critical Directory Protection**: Prevents operations on system directories

### üß™ Dry-Run Mode

- **Activation**: Press `d` on the confirmation screen
- **Functionality**: Simulates all operations without executing
- **Report**: Shows exactly what would be removed
- **Security**: Allows complete preview before actual execution

### üö® Implemented Protections

#### Protected Critical Directories
```go
var criticalPaths = []string{
    "/", "/usr", "/bin", "/etc", "/home", "/root", "/var", "/opt",
    "C:\\", "C:\\Windows", "C:\\Program Files", "C:\\Users",
}
```

#### Security Checks
- Unique confirmation hash per session
- Path integrity verification
- Permission validation before execution
- Protection against critical system paths

### üîß Emergency Recovery

In case of issues:

1. **Available Backup**: Restore from `~/.fugo/backups/`
2. **Detailed Logs**: Check `~/.fugo/*.log` for diagnosis
3. **Dry-Run Mode**: Use to test before execution
4. **Safe Interruption**: Ctrl+C cancels operation with logs

### üõ°Ô∏è Usage Recommendations

#### Before Execution
- [ ] Run first in dry-run mode (`d`)
- [ ] Check if you have important backups
- [ ] Confirm you have necessary privileges
- [ ] Read detection logs carefully

#### During Execution
- [ ] Read each confirmation step carefully
- [ ] Verify the security hash
- [ ] Confirm backup location
- [ ] Monitor progress messages

#### After Execution
- [ ] Check logs in `~/.fugo/`
- [ ] Confirm backup was created
- [ ] Test that Go was completely removed
- [ ] Clear environment variables (PATH, GOROOT, GOPATH)

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Permission Errors
```bash
sudo ./fugo  # Linux/macOS
# or run as Administrator on Windows
```

#### Backup Failed
- Check available disk space
- Confirm write permissions in `~/.fugo/`
- Verify `tar` command is available

#### Incomplete Detection
- Run with administrative privileges
- Check for installations in non-standard locations
- Consult logs for more details
